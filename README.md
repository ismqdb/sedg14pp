Like many others, I struggled with pointers when I first encountered them.

After mastering the basics, I decided to turn that initial challenge into a strength by focusing on more advanced topics, such as linked lists, binary trees, and similar data structures.

This repository is a collection of the code I wrote while learning data structures and algorithms from Sedgewick's book. As Iâ€™m still studying from it, the repository is actively updated with new content.

It is designed to showcase my skills in C++, OOP and DSA.
