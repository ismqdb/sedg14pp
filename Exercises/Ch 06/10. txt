I would say it doesn't have any extraneous pushes.

The recursive version calls the function for both left and right node, 
which means that both of these get pushed to the stack (one that compiler created).

On the other hand, the iterative version pushes only the right nodes to the stack,
which is half of what the recursive version pushes.
